It contains all (read "each and every one") of the files I've ever created during the course MM2090 that I took at IIT Madras. Feel free to try out stuff from here and use anything you need or feel will be useful.

## 2021 Update
All content has now been uploaded and is free to be used, would be great if proper attributions and credit is given.
